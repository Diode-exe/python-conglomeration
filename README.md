## Info
Hey there! My online name is Diode, and I am a Python and HTML programmer based in Canada.\
Welcome to the Python page! \
Essentially, this page is a conglomeration (a mix of things that may not go together) of Python scripts. The root program is what you run, to start the other programs. \
There is a brute force program that basically just goes character by character until it prints the script you want. The brute form LS (line spam) one does the same thing, but slightly different in that each character change is a seperate line.\
The calculator is just standard calculator. As of yet, it only supports 2 numbers. I'll eventually implement more. It currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, percentage, square root and fraction calculation operations. \
The number guessing game is just a number guessing game. It has 3 difficulty settings. Up to a max of 10 numbers apart. You have three guesses on the max difficulty.
They are quite self explanatory, even just looking at the file names.\
## Prerequisites and dependencies\
You must use a venv for this to work, and it **must be called test-venv**. \
This also will only work on Linux systems. Sorry. You may be able to use Windows Subsystem for Linux, though. \
## Dependencies
Note: Some of these may already be installed\
string, time, subprocess, tkinter, math, fractions, random, keyboard, playsound\
string time subprocess tkinter math fractions random keyboard playsound
### Installation
pip install keyboard playsound\
If you're using Python 3 and pip doesn't work, try:\
python3 -m pip install keyboard playsound\
Or on Windows (experimental):\
py -m pip install keyboard playsound\
