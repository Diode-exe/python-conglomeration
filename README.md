Hey there! My name is [REDACTED], and I am a Python and HTML programmer based in Canada. 
Welcome to the Python page! 
Essentially, this page is a conglomeration (a mix of things that may not go together) of Python scripts. The root program is what you run, to start the other programs. 
There is a brute force program that basically just goes character by character until it prints the script you want. The brute form LS (line spam) one does the same thing, but slightly different in that each character change is a seperate line.
The calculator is just standard calculator. As of yet, it only supports 2 numbers. I'll eventually implement more. It currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as percentage and square root calculations. 
The number guessing game is just a number guessing game. It has 3 difficulty settings. Up to a max of 10 numbers apart. You have three guesses on the max difficulty.
